          bio="I like to experiment with the quantum information stored in trapped ions.
            I lead now a group sharing the same passion. In my previous life, I measured how
            strong electric fields change the magnetic moment of the electron, studied
            quantum chaos, ran quantum gates, characterized entangled states, and teleported
            quantum information over 10 micrometers. Notable current achievements of my group
            are ultra low-noise ion traps and a Michelson-Morley test for electrons. When not
            behind a keyboard, I love being outside such as on playgrounds with my daughters
            or on the water windsurfing."
