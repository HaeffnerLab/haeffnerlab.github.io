We develop novel ion trap technology that supports quantum information tasks such as computing and sensing.

In collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Riverside, we pioneered ion traps manufactured via two-photon-direct laser writing. This technology allows to print complex three-dimensional structures with sub-micrometer resolution. Theses 3D-printed ion traps combine the advantages, such as strong radial confinement, of traditionally machined 3D traps with on-chip miniaturization. The tight confinement eases ion cooling requirements and speeds up a variety of important operations. More importantly, the design freedom of these 3D printed traps allows the researcher to customize these traps to their needs in quantum information science, precision metrology, and mass spectrometry.
