Raw data as obtained after preselection (see the paper).
For N={4,5} no preselection is done. 
The first column indicates the measurement basis. To resolve
it, leave the decimal systeme and go the the 3-system.
Then each digit corresponds to an ion, where the
value of the digit codes the rotation as follows:
0=no rotation
1=sigma_x
2=sigma_y

The other columns are the probabilities for the different
quantum states: We start with DDDDD, DDDDS, DDDSD, DDDSS, .... SSSSS.
